This set of scripts to program a Kria SOM.

These scripts use the program_flash program from the Xilinx tools.
At the time of writing this was using 2021.2 versions.
The program_flash program is not part of the lab edition.
It is only available in the Vitis tool set.

The Vitis tool set can take multiple hours to download and multiple hours to
install.

If you are a Linaro employee you can use a cutdown version that is 6GB and 
can be installed via un'taring it.  This can be found here:
