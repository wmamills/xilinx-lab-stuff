Subject: [PATCH 3/3] HACK: device-tree: use KV260 Rev1 as default DTB

The first attempt at DT matching did not work.
This patch changes the default DTB to be KV260 Rev1 (w/ Starter SOM)
This makes production SOM work just like starter SOM.
Ethernet now works in U-boot and kernel gets real MAC addr
(thus it gets the same IP addr each time)

This makes USB work in the kernel as well as Starter SOM.
(kernel gives error messages on some accesses but it still seems to work.)
