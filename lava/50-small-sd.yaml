# Example of a small system
#
# Uses boot.bin and a small SD card image.
#
# For convenance, this uses the recovery assets as the the system.
# This is OK because:
# * The recovery filesystem has no special powers
#   * It just boots and waits to be told what to do
# * recovery-boot.bin is only special when in the recovery slot
#   * This firmware always loads the recovery script from QSPI and runs it
#   * The recovery script only does recovery if the board was booted for the
#     recovery slot (it knows by looking at multiboot u-boot var)
#   * Otherwise it goes on to do normal distro boot and will see boot.scr on
#     the sd card
